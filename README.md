# Dokusho

Kind of tired to need an Android Device on me, just to read manga, so here we are.


I am going to prioritize feature based on how I feel and not people expectation, you know the saying if you want something do it yourself (or pay me/someone to do it if you don't know how).     


Also this is my first iOS App and first time with Swift/SwiftUI so code is a mess, sorry about this, I will try to fix it once I am more skilled in Swift 


It's a OSS project (see license) so unless your code is a bigger mess than mine and/or doesn't work I see no reason to refuse your PR, even if that's the case you can still fix it, so don't hesitate to make a PR

Alternative to consider:    
- ~~MangaSoup, v2 should be the best one for iOS I think~~ (sorry dead...) 
- Paperback (not a fan, but great work nevertheless)
- One from the app store (no seriously don't do this they are mostly full of ads)

## Features
- MultiSource (see progress in [MangaScraper](https://github.com/AzSiAz/MangaScraper) repository)
- Library stored in GRDB
- Multi collection (only one manga per collection)
- some Library Filter and order (saved)
- Very basic manga/webtoon/etc reader and a way to change reader direction
- Backup/Restore

## Working On
- Save reader direction for manga/webtoon/etc.

## Planned
- Tracker (maybe, I don't use them anymore)
- Scroll to next chapter in reader
- One manga in multiple collection, maybe
- Cleanup DB, cache
- Cloudflare bypass (pain in the ass when you are hit currently)
- Double Page reader
- Download
- CloudKit
